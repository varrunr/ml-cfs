LinSched is a user-space program that hosts the Linux scheduling subsystem. Its 
purpose is to provide a tool for observing and modifying the behavior of the
Linux scheduler, and prototyping new Linux scheduling policies, in a way that
may be easier (or otherwise less painful or time-consuming) to many developers
than direct experimentation with the Linux kernel, especially in the initial
stages of development. Due to the high degree of code sharing between LinSched
and the Linux scheduler, porting LinSched code to Linux is reasonably
straightforward. LinSched may be especially useful to those who are new to
Linux scheduler development.

The code provided in this source distribution is still somewhat messy and
documentation is limited (see "LinSched: The Linux Scheduler Simulator",
which was published at PDCCS 2008 and should be available at the same website
at which you downloaded this source code). I have not yet had the chance to
perform the cleanup necessary to release a better version, but may do so in
the future. If you do any code cleanup yourself, please let me know as it may
be useful to incorporate it into LinSched. Since LinSched is a derivative work
of Linux (kernel version 2.6.23.14), it is licensed under the GPLv2.

LinSched should compile successfully using "make" on 32-bit Intel platforms
using the gcc 4.0 compiler. Doing so builds the "linsched" program which will
run an example simulation using the LinSched API. LinSched has also compiled
and run successfully on 64-bit Intel platforms when the -m32 compiler option
was used. While there has been some success building LinSched using gcc 3.4.x,
doing so is not recommended and will require modification of the Makefile.

If you do something useful with LinSched, modify it in a way that may be
interesting to others (such as porting it to a new hardware platform or adding
new features), or just have general feedback, feel free to contact me.

Please check the README and license files in linux-2.6.23.14 directory for
information about Linux source code that is included with this distribution
of LinSched.
